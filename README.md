Explanation of data source on New Zealand school Zones
The current school enrolment scheme information is released by the Ministry of Education on its Education Counts website
(https://www.educationcounts.govt.nz/data-services/school-enrolment-zones).

I have requested 2010-2022 New Zealand school zone shape files data from the Ministry of Education, 
and have received some of school zone changes data from 2017 to 2020 from MoE.

Besides, there is a nation wide school zone shape file data in 2010 provided by Koordinate.
My search on google leads me to a historical link
https://www.educationcounts.govt.nz/__data/assets/file/0003/108606/Enrolment-Scheme-master.zip, 
with which I managed to download some archive files from Wayback Machine
(http://web.archive.org/web/2020*/https://www.educationcounts.govt.nz/__data/assets/file/0003/108606/Enrolment-Scheme-master.zip).

All above hunting harvest the files attached.
